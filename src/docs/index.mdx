# ThemeToggle

The central component of `react-color-scheme-switch`.
Most basically (without attached behavior),
it just looks like this:

<pre>&lt;ThemeToggle /></pre>

<ThemeToggle />

Click on it to see its three positions.
They represent (from left to right):
day/light mode, auto mode, and night/dark mode.

Specify `setRoot` to make it set `<html data-colour-scheme="dark|light"/>`):

<pre>&lt;ThemeToggle setRoot /></pre>

<ThemeToggle setRoot />
